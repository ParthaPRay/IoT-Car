This Robotic things are envisaged to have more human interaction when integrated with Internet of Things (IoT). An experimental set up is framed to validate the concept of Internet of Things based Robotic Car Control (loRCar), as proof of concept. Heterogeneous hardware platforms, communication protocols, technologies, sensors, actuators, and even operating systems are assembled together to validate the underlying approach of integrating robotic things with the IoT in reality. Publish and subscribe time to and from the IoRCar are measured 46ms and 34ms. Time to delay in data push to the Xively cloud is measured as 254ms.

This paper presents a novel architectural design of IoRCar
that validates the integrity issues by leveraging heterogeneous
hardware platforms, communication technologies, network
protocols, operating systems, and sensors / actuators together.
The implementation shows the actual implications of IoT with
robotics in novel form.
